# Temporal-Community-Detection
Using temporal information in a time stamped dynamic network to derive information about static communities with varying activation profiles.

Initial thoughts - Finding communities using the yelp dataset.

Overall goal: Using temporal information in a dynamic network to derive information about static communities with varying activation profiles. We assume that over the timescale sampled, community membership is fixed relative to the activity of the communities themselves, which can vary in activity or be on/off.
